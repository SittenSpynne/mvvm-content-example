# mvvm-content-example
An example of an MVVM project for a reddit post.

The thread itself is at https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/v2laxc/mvvm_trouble_subscribing_to_events_between/. The gist is to demonstrate an MVVM project that has a main window with a content area that can display different components, where the components can navigate to each other.
